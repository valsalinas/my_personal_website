		<h1>Welcome to my web page!</h1>
		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>Hello, my name is Valerie. I am currently a senior at UTSA, studying Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering and Data Science.</p>
		<h2>School</h2>
		<p>	As part of my Computer Science degree with a concentration in Software Engineering and Data Science, I have completed a diverse range of courses that have strengthened my technical skills and problem-solving abilities. These include:<br>
		
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Core Programming and Software Development: Programming 1 and 2 for Computer Scientists, Systems Programming, Applications Programming, Programming Languages, User Interfaces<br/>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Computer Science Foundations:</b> Data Structures, Analysis of Algorithms, Math Foundations of CS, Discrete Math Structures, Computer Organization<br/>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Database and Security:</b> Database Systems, Principles of Cyber Security<br/>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mathematics and Theoretical CS:</b> Calculus 1 and 2, Discrete Math Structures<br/>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Currently In Progress:</b> Computer Architecture, Web Technologies, Operating Systems, Data Science.<br/>
		</p>
		<h2>Hobbies</h2>
		<p>In my spare time, I enjoy reading, playing games, and watching movies. In my spare time, I enjoy reading, playing games, and watching movies. I also love exploring new technologies, coding personal projects, and learning about game development. When I’m not in front of a screen, I enjoy  traveling, and spending time with friends and family. I have a passion for storytelling across different media and enjoy seeing how games, movies, and books draw people in through immersive worlds and compelling narratives.</p>
		<h2>Work</h2>
		<p>	After graduating with my Computer Science degree, specializing in Software Engineering and Data Science, I want to work in a role that combines problem-solving, creativity, and technology. Through my current internship in game development, I’ve really enjoyed building interactive experiences and working with cutting-edge tech, so I’d love to continue in that direction.
		Ideally, I’d like to work as a Game Developer, Software Engineer, or Data Scientist in the gaming industry—somewhere I can use my technical skills to create immersive experiences, optimize performance, or even incorporate AI into gameplay. That said, I’m also open to software engineering or data science roles outside of gaming, especially in industries that focus on large-scale applications, AI, or data-driven decision-making. Whether it’s improving game engines, building intelligent tools, or developing innovative software, my goal is to work on meaningful projects and keep growing as a developer.
		Most of all, I want to be in a dynamic, collaborative environment where I can continue learning and pushing the limits of what technology can do.
